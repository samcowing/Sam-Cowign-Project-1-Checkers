# Sam-Cowing-Project-1-Checkers
Planning 
1. Structure
2. Making the board
3. Rules
- Board 
-- A classic 8x8 chessboard, only the dark squares are used.
-- It is positioned so that each player has a light square on the right side corner.
-- 24 discs (12 of 2 colors)

Typically, they are flat and round. The color of one set is black and the other red or white or beige.
- Game play
-- Checkers is played by two players.
-- Each player begins the game with 12 discs and places them on the 12 dark squares closest to him or her.
-- Black opens the game, then players alternate their turns.
-- The pieces always move diagonally and standard (non-king) pieces are always limited to forward moves.
-- A piece making a non-capturing move may move only one square.
- Captures (not MVP)
-- To capture a piece of your opponent, your piece leaps over one of the opponent's pieces and lands in a straight diagonal line on the other side. This landing square must be empty.
-- When a piece is captured, it is removed from the board.
-- Only one piece may be captured in a single jump, but multiple jumps are allowed on a single turn.
-- If a player is able to make the capture, then the jump must be made.
-- If more than one capture is available, then the player decides if he prefers this or not.
-- Standard pieces may shift direction diagonally during a multiple capture turn, but must always jump forward (toward the opponent).
- Upgrade a piece to a King (not MVP)
-- When a piece reaches the furthest row, it is crowned and becomes a king.
-- One of the pieces which had been captured is placed on top of the king so that it is twice as high as a single piece.
-- Kings are limited to moving diagonally but can move both forward and backward.
-- Kings may combine jumps in several directions (forward and backward) on the same turn.
- End of the Game
-- A player wins the game when the opponent cannot make a move.
-- This happens usually because all of the opponent's pieces have been captured, but it could also be because all of his pieces are blocked in.
